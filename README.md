# YogaClassAdmission
Problem Statement

Assume that you are the CTO of an outsourcing firm which has been chosen to build an
admission form for the Yoga Classes which happen every month.
Requirements for the admission form are:

- Only people within the age limit of 18-65 can enroll for the monthly classes and they will
be paying the fees on a month on month basis. I.e. an individual will have to pay the fees
every month and he can pay it any time of the month.
- They can enroll any day but they will have to pay for the entire month. The monthly fee is
500/- Rs INR.
- There are a total of 4 batches a day namely 6-7AM, 7-8AM, 8-9AM and 5-6PM. The
participants can choose any batch in a month and can move to any other batch next
month. I.e. participants can shift from one batch to another in different months but in the
same month they need to be in the same batch.
